# LDA-Topic-Modeling-Legal-Documents
Itâ€™s a challenge for the legal community to scavenge thru the abundance of legislative documents to access the information they need. There is a need for assistance in organizing and retrieving such documents. This study attempts to address these concerns by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topics within the text. Topics that are of similar nature can be clustered together and depicted using pyLDA visualizations. Documents can also be tagged based on their correlation to the various topics extracted.   Legal documents can change with time, leading to new policies and concerns. This study also uses Dynamic Topic Modelling (DTM) to capture the changes in topics over time. Trends of evolution can be captured and displayed visually for interpretation.
